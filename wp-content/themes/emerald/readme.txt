Using the homepage slider
===========================

To use the homepage slider first go to the theme options panel and select a category that you want to use for the slider. Every post published under that category will appear on the homepage slider. The featured image will be used as the slider image and the post title will be used as the slide title.

Using an image logo
===========================

Emerald allows you to use an image logo instead of the standard text title. Just add the image URL in the options panel and hit save.
