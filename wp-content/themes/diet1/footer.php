Dear Wordpress User,

As you can see a lot of effort, work and time (which includes years of learning) have gone into this wordpress template. I'm proud that you like the design enough to want it on your blog.

Please respect the designer's work by not removing the links from the bottom of the page (footer.php). These links are the only thing encouraging further development of wordpress templates.

Thank you very much :)
